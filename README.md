# About
This repository was established during various job interviews that I have been attended.
The questions were collected during technical interviews for the Java Developer position.
My goals are to provide concentrated knowledge of topics and questions what's to be expected when attending such meetings.
At every question there should be provided answer, explanation or link to place when you can gather information about certain topic.
